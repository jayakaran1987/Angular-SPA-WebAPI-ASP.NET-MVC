Please consider the following points when evaluating the code.

To make this assignment simple, I did not use the Dependency Injection libraries but I clearly mentioned in the code where we need to use IOC.
I have created the Unit Test to ensure the calculation service deliver the correct results based on the acceptance criteria.
Due to the limited time I did not cover Unit Test coverage for API Controller.
I have created a custom exception handling in the event of an error scenario as mentioned in the question.
As I mentioned in the interview, I don't have commercial experience in Angular Js development but I attempted using Angular Js Partial views and Routing as requested.

Please let me know if you need any more details or clarifications.
